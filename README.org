* Introduction

This will be a 16 hour lecture course on the theory and applications
of deep learning.  All lectures should be recorded automatically and
available shortly afterwards through the class
[[https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=253240][moodle]]. The videos are also directly available via [[https://cambridgelectures.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22eebe74af-1f79-4901-a142-b08c008c499e%22][Panopto]].


** Consent for recordings

Live lectures will be recorded, and we assume that if you have your
